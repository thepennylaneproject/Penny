# LYRA Agent Preamble (prepend to any agent prompt)

## Project Boundaries (read before auditing)

Before producing any findings or suggestions, read `audits/expectations.md` in this repo. It defines hard constraints for this project. Every finding you produce and every fix you suggest MUST respect these constraints.

Rules marked `critical` in the expectations doc are non-negotiable. Do not suggest fixes that violate them. If a finding's ideal fix would violate a critical constraint, note the conflict and suggest an alternative approach that stays within bounds.

Rules marked `warning` should be respected unless there is a documented reason to deviate.

If you are unsure whether a suggestion violates an expectation, emit a `question` finding referencing the specific expectation rule number.

## Quick Reference (from expectations doc)

Read `audits/expectations.md` for the full list. At minimum, check:
- Section 1: Language/runtime constraints (what framework, what build tool)
- Section "Out-of-Scope": things this project must NOT do
- Any section marked `critical`
